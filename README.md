# A-New-Era-of-Data-Analysis-in-Baseball
Use MLB's Statcast Data to compare New York Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton

#1 Using the pandas library, load the databases into the jupyter notebook

#2 Conduct exploratory data analysis function pd.tail() in order to see the bottom 5 rows

#3 Feature engineered additional columns that isolated each player's batted ball events 

#4 Isolated the hitter's hit zones that resulted in homeruns and displayed the area using seaborn's regplots and kdeplots

#5 Used a boxplot to measure pitch speeds against homeruns to see which batter was hitting homeruns from the speed of the pitch

#6 Created a function to dictate the location(s) in the batter's box in which the batter hits a homerun

#7 Use the Matplotlib library to create a heat map of the zones in which each batter hit a homerun
